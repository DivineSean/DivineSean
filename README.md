# Hi, I'm Mohamed Arkik

I’m a **Software Engineer** so passionate that my coffee fears me.  
In a world full of bugs and bad Wi-Fi, I dare to conquer **full-stack development**, **networking**, and **3D graphics programming** — all before my third cup of coffee (sometimes before breakfast).

I write code, connect stuff, and make things spin in 3D — occasionally on purpose.  
Basically, if it has code, wires, or polygons, I’ve probably broken it, fixed it, and added a feature no one asked for.
